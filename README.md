In this project, we have identified how covid-19 Impacted employment rates in California. We used two datasets: the primary dataset being the covid-19 cases and the secondary dataset is the unemployment rate in California. We derived five hypotheses after reviewing the data to see how the employment rate has increased or decreased from Q2 of 2020 to Q2 of 2022. In this research, we want to comprehend how some sectors were impacted by COVID, which resulted in unemployment, and how certain industries saw an increase in income as the employment rate increased.
